## About Nag

Nag is a web-application designed to check in on me at periodic intervals
to ensure I am making progress on items.  It is a personal micro-blogging tool.

It should be lightweight, easy, and useful.

At the end of the day, it will show me what I've done, and maybe someday
it can help me prioritize.

### User Experience

Every 25 minutes, ask me what I've been doing since whatever I was doing since last checkin.
