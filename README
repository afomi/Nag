== Nag

Nag is a web-application designed to check in on me at periodic intervals
to ensure I am making progress on an item.

It should be lightweight, easy, and useful.

At the end of the day, it will show me what I've done, and maybe someday
it can help show me what to do.


== User Experience

Every 30 minutes, ask me what I've been doing since whatever I was doing 30 minutes ago.
